# VBA-challenge
Repository for the second challenge.

I got it!
1) So, in the first image of the SS directory, we can see the multiple_year_stock_data, which i used
to run the final code.
2)Then, in the second image, I'm asigning the macro to a button so it runs when I click it.
3)In 3 and 4 image, I show that all the sheets are empty.
4)In video 5 I added the script at vba, it's also in the file "code.vba" and in the alphabetical_testing file.
5)In image 6 to 8 I show the results of each sheet after clicking the button
6)After everything, I closed the file without saving, so you can run the code.
7)And thats it!
